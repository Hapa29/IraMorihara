            <p> This letter was written by one of Ira's fellow engineering students: <p>
            <i>Hello, it's me J-, I had written this letter to the fellow searchers but I wanted to send this to all of you because I know that we all grieve in our own way, and I wrote this letter as my way of grieving.  I hope this letter will help you in your time of need.  Just know that I am praying for all of you and I ask that you all please keep Ira, his family and his friends in your prayers, God bless you all & Ira...J.<p>
            Dear S.,<p>
            First off I would like to let you know that this e-mail might not make any sense and be completely random, I am writing whatever comes to mind.  I would like to say thank you.  Thank you for keeping Ira in your prayers.  He is one of God's children and now he is with Him.<p>
            I have been having a difficult day.  Ira was in almost all of my classes and it was hard looking over to my right waiting to hear Ira whisper some wise crack or a joke that would bust me up laughing in class.  He would always tease me in class whenever I got picked on by a teacher, but even if I got the wrong answer or even the right answer we would always get into an argument.  I think it was because we both wanted things our way.  But through it all we remained friends.<p>
            If homework was due the next day, people knew that I was with Ira and A.  I will miss having Ira over whenever he got locked out of his apartment and I will miss the way he used to go through my cabinets in the kitchen searching for food.<p>
            It's pretty funny cause I recently found out that the reason he didn't have any food at his place was because he was saving every penny to get a new surfboard.  Talk about dedication, I probably couldn't save one dollar.<p>
            He is an amazing guy who had so many dreams, so much will, and gave so much of himself and his heart in everything that he did.  Ira was one of those people that you just hope you would run into on campus because he would always bring a smile to your face. I hold Ira dear to my heart, the last time I cried so much was the night of search IV.  I believe it was a sign.  God and Ira together along with all those that we have lost cried with us today and smiled with us today.  <p>
            After I said good-bye to Ira today the wind was blowing and the sun began to shine.  As I sat in the hospital holding Ira's hand, as I prepared my dinner tonight and as I write to you now I know Ira is with me and with us all.  Searchers you are wonderful people and I keep you in my prayers.  I know that it will be a long process for me to get through this and I ask that you please keep Ira, his family, and his friends in your prayers.<p>
            On Wednesday during my break at around 9:30 am, I saw Ira sitting by the fountain, just sitting and staring away, peaceful with his legs swinging in the air and his skateboard next to him.  He told me he usually sleeps during his break but that day he told me that he finally realized that it was a waste of time to go back to his room and sleep during that hour of the morning.  Who would have known it would be one of the last times I would see him on campus.<p>
            Well, I must go, thank you for taking time to read this.  I love you all and today and everyday please take the time to say more than hi and how are you to someone who passes by you on campus...J.</i>
